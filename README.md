# SQL-Practice
This SQL script provides a comprehensive set of queries and operations for managing and interacting with a database containing manufacturers and products. Here is a breakdown of what each query or operation achieves:

Creation of Manufacturers and Products Tables:

Manufacturers table holds information about manufacturers with a unique code and name.

Products table holds product details (name, price, and manufacturer). It includes a foreign key that references the Manufacturers table to link each product with its manufacturer.
Inserting Data:

Sample data is inserted into both Manufacturers and Products tables. These inserts define various manufacturers and products with associated prices and manufacturers.
Exercises with Queries:

Exercise 1-2: Fetch product names and prices from the Products table.

Exercise 3-4: Filter products by price criteria (<= 200, between 60 and 120).

Exercise 5: Display product names with prices in cents.

Exercise 6-7: Compute the average price of all products and products by a specific manufacturer.

Exercise 8-9: Count products with a price above a threshold and order the results by price and name.

Exercise 10-11: Join Products and Manufacturers tables to combine data about products and their manufacturers.

Exercise 12-14: Compute the average price for each manufacturer and filter by average price greater than or equal to 150.

Exercise 15: Find the cheapest product in the store.

Exercise 16: Find the most expensive product of each manufacturer.

Exercise 17: Find manufacturers with average product prices above $145 and at least two different products.
Data Modification:

Exercise 18: Insert a new product (Loudspeakers) into the Products table.

Exercise 19: Update the name of a product (Laser Printer).

Exercise 20-21: Apply a 10% discount to all products and to products above a specific price.

These queries cover a broad range of SQL operations, including basic selection, filtering, aggregation, updates, and joins.
